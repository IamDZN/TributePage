        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Arthur C. Clarke's life:</h3>
        <li><strong>1917</strong> <br> Born in Minehead, Somerset, England and grew up in nearby Bishops
          Lydeard. As a boy, he lived on a farm, where he enjoyed stargazing, fossil collecting, and reading American
          science fiction pulp magazines. He received his secondary education at Huish Grammar school in Taunton.</li>
        <li><strong>1935</strong> <br> In his teens, he joined the Junior Astronomical Association and contributed to
          Urania, the society's journal, which was edited in Glasgow by Marion Eadie. At Clarke's request, she added an
          Astronautics Section, which featured a series of articles by him on spacecraft and space travel. He also
          became a member of the British Interplanetary Society.</li>
        <li><strong>1937</strong> <br> Civil servant at the Exchequer and Audit Department.</li>
        <li><strong>1941</strong> <br> During the Second World War from 1941 to 1946 he served in the Royal Air Force
          as a radar specialist and was involved in the early-warning radar defence system, which contributed to the RAF's
          success during the Battle of Britain. Clarke spent most of his wartime service working on ground-controlled
          approach (GCA) radar, as documented in the semi-autobiographical Glide Path, his only non-science-fiction
          novel.</li>
        <li><strong>1945</strong> <br> Published a paper on satelite communications in Wireless Worlds, an engineering
          periodical. Although he was not the originator of the concept of geostationary satellites, one of his most
          important contributions in this field may be his idea that they would be ideal telecommunications relays. He
          advanced this idea in a paper privately circulated among the core technical members of the British
          Interplanetary Society in 1945.Clarke also wrote a number of non-fiction books describing the technical
          details and societal implications of rocketry and space flight</li>
        <li><strong>1946</strong> <br> Discharged from the army and enrolled at King's College in London on a
          scholarship.</li>
        <li><strong>1948</strong> <br> Graduated with first class honors in Physics & Mathematics. After this he worked
          as an assistant editor at Physics Abstracts. Clarke then served as president of the British Interplanetary
          Society from 1946 to 1947 and again from 1951 to 1953.</li>
        <li><strong>1953</strong> <br> Published fifth novel, Childhood's End, finally gaining him popular and critical
          attention. He also got married into Marilyn Mayfield, but separated within a year.</li>
        <li><strong>1956</strong> <br> Won the Hugo Award for the short story "The Star". He visited Sri Lanka first in
          Unawatuna on the south coast, and then in Colombo. Initially, he and his friend Mike Wilson travelled around
          Sri Lanka, diving in the coral waters around the coast with the Beachcombers club. In 1957, during a dive
          trip off Trincomalee, Clarke discovered with his friend Mike Wilson the underwater ruins of a temple which
          would subsequently make the region popular with divers to dive in the coral waters. He subsequently described
          it in his 1957 book The Reefs of Taprobane. This was his second diving book after the 1956 The Coast of
          Coral. He moved to Sri Lanka, which would become his permanent home.</li>
        <li><strong>1968</strong> <br> Published the first book in a new series entitled A Space Odyssey (the book was
          called 2001: A Space Odyssey) & movie version is called "2001: A Space Odyssey".</li>
        <li><strong>1973</strong> <br> Published popular "Rendezvous with Rama" book.</li>
        <li><strong>1975</strong> <br> The Sri Lankan government offered Clarke honourary resident guest status in
          1975. He was held in such high esteem that when fellow science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein came to
          visit, the Sri Lanka Air Force provided a helicopter to take them around the country.</li>
        <li><strong>1982</strong> <br> Published "2010: Odyssey Two" book.</li>
        <li><strong>1987</strong> <br> Published "2061: Odyssey Three" book.</li>
        <li><strong>1997</strong> <br> Published "3001: The Final Odyssey" book.</li>
        <li><strong>1998</strong> <br> Clarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) "for
          services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka" and knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. The same year he
          became the first Chancellor of the International Space University, serving from 1989 to 2004. He also served
          as Chancellor of Moratuwa University in Sri Lanka.</li>
        <li><strong>2008</strong> <br> Clarke died in Sri Lanka on 19 March 2008 after suffering from respiratory
          failure, according to Rohan de Silva, one of his aides. His aide described the cause as respiratory
          complications and heart failure stemming from post-polio syndrome. Just hours before Clarke's death a massive
          gamma-ray burst(GRB) reached Earth. Known as GRB 080319B, the burst set a new record as the farthest object
          that could be seen from Earth with the naked eye. It occurred about 7.5 billion years ago (roughly equal to
          half the time since the Big Bang), taking the light that long to reach Earth. It was suggested by Larry
          Sessions, a science writer for Sky and Telescope magazine blogging on earthsky.org, that the burst be named
          "The Clarke Event". American Atheist Magazine wrote of the idea: "It would be a fitting tribute to a man who
          contributed so much, and helped lift our eyes and our minds to a cosmos once thought to be province only of
          gods."</li>

        <p>"He was a great visionary, a brilliant science fiction writer and a great forecaster. He foresaw
          communications satellites, a nationwide network of computers, interplanetary travel; he said there would be a
          man on the moon by 1970, while I said 1980 - and he was right."</p>
